# Getting started reviewing

Reviewing is a great way to give back to the community. At first, reviewing can
be very stressful and sometimes it may feel that it is not clear what you should
do. Below are two articles that my advisor (Jack Snoeyink) shared with me when
I first started reviewing papers.  I found them very helpful, I hope you find
them helpful as well:

* [A Guide for New Referees in Theoretical Computer
  Science](./guide-for-new-referees.pdf) by Ian Parberry
* [Hints for Referees](./hints_for_referees.pdf) by Donald Knuth

One additional piece of advice to always keep in mind with your reviews though
is your feedback should never be personal and should always be constructive.

## Common Feedback on Reviews:

Here is a list of feedback that addresses common issues with reviews:

* The review should address the _submission_ not the _person_.  As such, in your
  revew, please write about the paper / methods / etc, but not about the
  authors.  (e.g., instead of `the authors fail to do X` instead write
  `Including X in the paper would have strengthened the paper`
