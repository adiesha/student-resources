# Welcome to CompTaG!

Welcome to the Computational Topology and Geometry (CompTaG) research group at
Montana State University! We are very excited to have you joining us! Below
you will find a variety of resources that will help you learn about the team
and become prepared to begin making contributions!

## Logistics

### Meeting Location
We currently meet at Faculty Court #23 (FC23). To obtain a
key for FC23, contact Suzie Hockel or Brittany Fasy.  (At this time,
keys are not given to undergraduate students.  However, undergraduates are
welcome to work at FC23).  Snacks and sodas are available on an honor system
cash payment in the kitchen.

### Weekly Meetings
See slack for the updated meeitng times.  We have a one hour research seminar
year-round, and a summer weekly book club.  In addition, we schedule
prove-a-thons, which is a common time to work on research problems.

## Onboarding Tasks

1. [Slack](https://alice-storytelling.slack.com/home): Most of the
   communication between team members occurs on Slack, which is a team
   collaboration software. Both web and mobile versions are available, and we
   encourage that you install Slack on your smartphone if possible. To be added
   to our Slack group, use the following link:
   [Slack-link](https://join.slack.com/t/tda-at-msu/shared_invite/enQtMjk4NDIwMjY2MDY2LTNhYTYwOWRjNWM3ZGU2MzdlODFkOTA5MzNiNTFmMDQyZTc2NzkxNGNjMjlmZGFjZGZlNmEyYTE2MjBhMGFhMjE).
    * Post a message to #general to introduce yourself to the group!
    * Click on the word `Channels` and join any conversations that seem
      interesting to you.

2. GIT: if you are not yet familiar with git (or need a refresher), please take
   the GIT Udacity course:
    [Git Udacity Course](https://www.udacity.com/course/how-to-use-git-and-github--ud775)

3. Reading: To get started in the filed, please see the Introductory Readings
   for Topics sections of
   [README](https://github.com/compTAG/student-resources#introductory-readings-for-topics)
   page.  For a crash course on some specific topics, watch these videos:
    * Persistent Homology: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h0bnG1Wavag&amp;t=16s
    * Topological Data Analysis: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XOZN3XZdoO0
    * Computational Geometry: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LuTHBkyLJ1k

4. Code: Papers (even theoretical ones) typically have an experimental section,
   which means that you should be comfortable running some code!  To get started, we have two tasks:
    * Compute persistent homology of a triangle using [Dionysus](https://www.mrzv.org/software/dionysus/)
    * Compute a Delaunay triangulation in  [CGAL](https://www.cgal.org/), and
     output the triangulation data structure.

5. TeamPapers: Our team has authored several papers that we encourage you to read in order to learn more about our work:
    * Searching in the space of persistence diagrams: https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.11257
    * PHT-based reconstruction: https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.11257 and https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.11257
    * Fast randomized point location without preprocessing in two-and three-dimensional Delaunay triangulations (by Binhai and collabs): https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925772198000352
    * On the Bootstrap for Persistence Diagrams and Landscapes (by Brittany and collabs): https://arxiv.org/abs/1311.0376
    * Parallel Geometric Algorithms for Multi-core Computers (by Dave and collabs): https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925772110000362
