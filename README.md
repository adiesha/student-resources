- [Ott's 10 Tips](http://www.ms.uky.edu/~kott/proof_help.pdf)

## Posters ##

Presenting posters at academic conferences is a great way to practice talking
about your research.  We recommend using Inkscape to create posters, and provide
a template in the poster folder.

- [Poster Tips](https://www.makesigns.com/tutorials/poster-design-layout.aspx):
  a great resource for knowing what font size to use, etc.
- [Inkscape Soup Can Tutorial](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/html/SoupCan.html): this tutorial gives you a jump start on using Inkscape (basically, the free version of illustrator).  Some keyboard shortcuts are given.
