# README #

In this repo, we provide resources for new students in theoretical computer
science / applied mathematics.  These are the resources that we have found
helpful for our students, and we hope will help you as well.

## Git ##

To clone this repo:
```
$ git clone https://brittany@bitbucket.org/tda-at-msu/student-templates.git

## Academic Writing ##

Academic writing is mastered in one way: practice and learn from your mistakes.  The following resources we find helpful:

- [Ott's 10 Tips](http://www.ms.uky.edu/~kott/proof_help.pdf)
- [Figure
  Captions](http://www.biosciencewriters.com/Tips-for-Writing-Outstanding-Scientific-Figure-Legends.aspx):
  This website is a great resource for how to write a figure caption. If you
  want a concrete example, take a look at [this
  paper](http://pub.ist.ac.at/~edels/Papers/2012-P-11-PHTheoryPractice.pdf) as
  well.

## Posters ##

Presenting posters at academic conferences is a great way to practice talking
about your research.  We recommend using Inkscape to create posters, and provide
a template in the poster folder.

- [Poster Tips](https://www.makesigns.com/tutorials/poster-design-layout.aspx):
  a great resource for knowing what font size to use, etc.
- [Inkscape Soup Can Tutorial](http://tavmjong.free.fr/INKSCAPE/MANUAL/html/SoupCan.html): this tutorial gives you a jump start on using Inkscape (basically, the free version of illustrator).  Some keyboard shortcuts are given.
